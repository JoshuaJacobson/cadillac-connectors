		Our FIRST competition is over! We had quite a few good games, and a few little mishaps. Overall we feel 
				that we preformed well, coming in at 28<sup>th</sup> out of 40 teams, many of whom had more years of expirience 
				than we did. After a week of tweaks and adjustments, we think we are ready to go to TC and be the best we 
				can be! Long-time mentor Jim Jakubos said, <i>"The robot functioned as inteded, we had a few electrical and programming errors, but those have been 
				fixed, and we are ready for our next competition"</i>.
				<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
				We made the following changes/improvements to our bot:
				<ul style="text-align:left">
					<li>We can now shoot high goals</li>
					<li>We secured the wiring so that it will cause less issues</li>
					<li>We added another autonomous program to deal with the moat</li>
				</ul>
				We have some videos on our homepage where you can see our robot in action.
		<!--Apologies for the giant lack of progress updates and news. As we have gotten closer to bag and tag day, 
		more and more information has been confidential. However, now that we are really close to bag and tag, 
		we feel that it would be okay to release more info in interest of our supporters and team friends. So, 
		in bulk, we have done a lot in terms of progress. As of me writing this, we have assembled the chassis, 
		and tested our ball intake and firing systems extensively. We have also started to secure components on 
		our electronics plate. Teleoperated Code is completed in Java, and we are on the verge of creating a few 
		autonomous programs. Below are some of the photos of the last few weeks. More to come tomarrow.
		<!--Today we deployed our first code to the robot, to test the spinning of the treads. 
		At first one spun much faster than the other, but then we fine tuned them to be in sync. 
		Tomorrow we plan on adding turning and a ball infeed.-->
		<!--Snow days do not stop us. Also, tank treads came in! We are working on not only building them, 
		but also the Sally Port. The Cheval de Frise is finished. We also started plans on the Drawbridge.-->
		<!--Today we headed over to Rexair to test the abilities of motors firing a ball. With our previous design, 
		we were on a 10 : 1 gearbox, and the ball shot out about as fast as a horse drawn carriage walking 
		through a molasses <b>moat.</b> So, purely to test the revolutions needed, we created a chute for the 
		ball to travel out of cardboard, gutted the inside of some vacuums, and spun them up to 6,000 RPM. As 
		you can see In the video, the ball definitely shoots.-->
		<!--We finished the ramparts today. Again, we have no tank treads. However, construction on the Cheval de Frise 
		has begun, as well as the Sally Port. We also worked on gearboxes. CAD is ever closer. Website team (All of 
		me, myself, and I) have coded the following segment to add a countdown to the homepage. Credit to Joseph 
		Foster @ http://frccountdown.hosthorde.net/ for the Idea.-->
		<!--Today we finished the Low bar, Moat, and Rock Wall. We also started work on the ramparts. Still no sign of
		 tank treads :( . Code and Build teams are waiting. CAD is getting closer. We also worked on some website 
		 things, fonts and colors!-->
		<!--We have drawn up our designs for the robot by hand on paper and whiteboard over the past few days, 
		now it is time for us to CAD them up. We are currently building our model defences and testing the 
		roboRIO (We had a problem with this "Robot Brain" from last year). A few days ago we ordered our parts 
		(Tank treads), and will start building as soon as they come in. Expect weekday progress reports from 
		here on out!-->
		<!--Our team is ramping up for the kickoff! We are planning on beginning work on our robot on kickoff day,
		and working for 4-5 hours per day, every week day, for the six week build session. Today we worked
		on cleaning up our working space in the Junior High. Unfortunatly we cannot make it to any events, so we are
		hosting our kickoff here.-->
		<!--We are currently preparing for the 2016 competition season. We have 7 new members possibly joining us this year!
		Many of us are eagerly anticipating January 9th, when we can finally see what the new game is. When the year starts,
		be prepared to see weekly updates in this section.-->
